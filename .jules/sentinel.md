## 2024-05-08 - SQL Injection in Like Queries
**Vulnerability:** In drizzle ORM, the `like` helper doesn't automatically escape wildcards, which can lead to algorithmic complexity DoS via wildcard injection.
**Learning:** Found in `apps/api/src/routes/users.ts` using `like(users.name, \`%\${q}%\`)` directly with user query.
**Prevention:** Use `sql` template literals with an `ESCAPE` clause and an escape function for literal wildcard characters instead of the built-in `like` helper when handling user input.

## 2024-05-18 - [Wildcard Injection via Drizzle like()]
**Vulnerability:** Drizzle ORM's `like()` function used in `apps/api/src/routes/users.ts` without escaping wildcards.
**Learning:** `like()` in Drizzle does not automatically escape `%` and `_` characters. User input passed directly to `like()` allows for wildcard injection, which could lead to algorithmic complexity Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
**Prevention:** Always manually escape wildcard characters in user input before passing it to SQL queries when using Drizzle, or use `sql` templates with explicit `ESCAPE` clauses.

## 2024-05-18 - OAuth Open Redirect via Weak Origin Validation
**Vulnerability:** A wildcard in the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` configuration allows the CORS and OAuth flow to accept any client-provided origin, leading to a bypass in origin verification and an open redirect where tokens can be stolen.
**Learning:** Utilities that resolve or validate origins against a configurable list should explicitly reject wildcard patterns in sensitive flows such as OAuth redirects or CORS responses, ensuring wildcards only apply when strictly intended by the configuration.
**Prevention:** Pass `{ allowWildcard: false }` to the `isAllowedOrigin` helper in all places where sensitive token delivery relies on frontend URLs.

## 2026-05-09 - [Disable Wildcard Origin Matching in CORS/CSRF Middleware]
**Vulnerability:** CORS and CSRF middleware configurations in `apps/api/src/index.ts` permitted wildcard subdomains by default, enabling Open Redirect and CSRF bypass risks if wildcard patterns were loosely validated against client-provided origins.
**Learning:** `isAllowedOrigin` defaults to allowing wildcard logic unless explicitly disabled.
**Prevention:** Explicitly supply `{ allowWildcard: false }` to the `isAllowedOrigin` calls in both CORS and CSRF verifications to disable loose wildcard checks and adhere to strictly provided `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` when processing origins outside of isolated `frontend_origin` callbacks.
