## 2024-05-08 - SQL Injection in Like Queries
**Vulnerability:** In drizzle ORM, the `like` helper doesn't automatically escape wildcards, which can lead to algorithmic complexity DoS via wildcard injection.
**Learning:** Found in `apps/api/src/routes/users.ts` using `like(users.name, \`%\${q}%\`)` directly with user query.
**Prevention:** Use `sql` template literals with an `ESCAPE` clause and an escape function for literal wildcard characters instead of the built-in `like` helper when handling user input.
