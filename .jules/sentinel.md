## 2024-05-08 - SQL Injection in Like Queries
**Vulnerability:** In drizzle ORM, the `like` helper doesn't automatically escape wildcards, which can lead to algorithmic complexity DoS via wildcard injection.
**Learning:** Found in `apps/api/src/routes/users.ts` using `like(users.name, \`%\${q}%\`)` directly with user query.
**Prevention:** Use `sql` template literals with an `ESCAPE` clause and an escape function for literal wildcard characters instead of the built-in `like` helper when handling user input.

## 2024-05-18 - [Wildcard Injection via Drizzle like()]
**Vulnerability:** Drizzle ORM's `like()` function used in `apps/api/src/routes/users.ts` without escaping wildcards.
**Learning:** `like()` in Drizzle does not automatically escape `%` and `_` characters. User input passed directly to `like()` allows for wildcard injection, which could lead to algorithmic complexity Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
**Prevention:** Always manually escape wildcard characters in user input before passing it to SQL queries when using Drizzle, or use `sql` templates with explicit `ESCAPE` clauses.

## 2024-05-18 - OAuth Open Redirect via Weak Origin Validation
**Vulnerability:** A wildcard in the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` configuration allows the CORS and OAuth flow to accept any client-provided origin, leading to a bypass in origin verification and an open redirect where tokens can be stolen.
**Learning:** Utilities that resolve or validate origins against a configurable list should explicitly reject wildcard patterns in sensitive flows such as OAuth redirects or CORS responses, ensuring wildcards only apply when strictly intended by the configuration.
**Prevention:** Pass `{ allowWildcard: false }` to the `isAllowedOrigin` helper in all places where sensitive token delivery relies on frontend URLs.
## 2026-05-10 - Missing Generic Database Error Test Cases
**Vulnerability:** Not a direct vulnerability, but a lack of testing for generic unexpected database errors can mask underlying issues or unhandled promise rejections that could leak sensitive stack traces or lead to DoS if they crash the server.
**Learning:** Hono routes handling Drizzle database operations should have tests that assert that `app.request` returns a 500 when an unhandled generic database error is thrown. The tests should be explicitly named to verify this behavior.
**Prevention:** Ensure routes that interact with the database have explicit "propagates general db [operation] errors" tests, especially for `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` endpoints, verifying a clean 500 response without leaking internal errors.
